# ENUME_Project2
A Numerical Method project cointaining 4 tasks. \
## 1. 
First task determines the polynomial that best fits the experimental data.
## 2.
Second task calculates the trajectory of a motion of a point described using given equations.
### a) 
Runge-Kutta method of 4th order (RK4) and Adams PC (P5EC5E) with a different step sizes.
### b)
Runge-Kutta mathod of 4th order with a variable step size automatically adjusted by the algorithm. \
With the error estimation.
